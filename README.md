# Testing-input-fields
***
Designing and writing test cases and their structures for a web page that has different input fields with various features.
***
**Input Forms:**
*  Two Input Fields  
*  Radio Buttons  
*  Select Dropdown List  
*  Date pickers
***
This is my very first testing project. The requirement was to create as many test cases as I could think of based on common sense, as there were no written requirements available for the SUT.

[And this is the above mentioned SUT](http://demo.seleniumeasy.com/)
