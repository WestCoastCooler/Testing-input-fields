# Testing-input-fields
Designing and writing test cases and their structures for a web page that has different input fields with various features, such as:

    Input Forms / Simple Form / Two Input Fields
    Input Forms / Radio Buttons 
    Input Forms / Select Dropdown List
    Input Forms / Date pickers

This is my very first testing project. The requirement was to find as many test cases I could think of based on common sense, as there were no written requirements available for the SUT.
