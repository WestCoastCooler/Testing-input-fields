# Testing-input-fields
Designing and writing test cases and their structures for a web page that has different input fields with various features, such as:

Input Forms - Simple Form - Two Input Fields
Input Forms - Radio Buttons
Input Forms - Select Dropdown List
Input Forms - Date pickers

This is my very first testing project. The requirement was to find as many test cases I could think of based on common sense, as there were no written requirements available for the SUT.
