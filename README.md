# Testing-input-fields
Designing and writing test cases and their structures for a web page that has different input fields with various features, such as:

Input Forms: Simple Form - Two Input Fields *** 
Radio Buttons *** 
Select Dropdown List *** 
Date pickers

This is my very first testing project. The requirement was to find as many test cases I could think of based on common sense, as there were no written requirements available for the SUT.
